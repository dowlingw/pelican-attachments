Pelican Attachments
===================
Allows page attachments to be hosted outside the `static` folder alongside articles.

For more information refer to my blog post:

How to use
----------
After installing the module, add `attachments` metadata tag with a list of files referenced by the article.

From there, continue to use |filename| as per usual.

Files will be output adjacent to the output article file.


Development Status
------------------
Buyer beware! This module was developed for personal use and probably contains plenty of bugs and omissions.
